Version 1 means For my College Final Year Project.
Here is my proposal of my college, enough to give you idea about the project(For the college).

## 1.0 Introduction
Self-growth industry is very treading now a days because most people are struggling to create good habits or routine by which they can automate their day and do something productivity about it. By digital revolution, its being very hard for user to focus on their work because they easily get distracted by smart phones, TV, or other gadgets. Most people are completely hooked to their mobile phone. Everything has its advantage and disadvantage. Although, digital phones are very addictive we can use it to create a platform where user can use their time productively rather that wasting it, and the addictive easy to use feature of smartphone can be used to make creating new habits an easy-to-follow addiction rather that a chaos.
	 
### 1.1 Problem statement
In daily life most of the time we have no idea what we should do now to make our day most productive. Or we got a big goal let’s say to work on fitness because we are getting obese, unhealthy, and inactive but we got no idea how to start working on it, or we got motivated for few days to go gym and start extreme diet but later fail because complexity to maintain it. Or we are over focusing on just working out in gym and doing our diet whole day that our productivity in office is getting horrible, reverse also true. Some people might think we need lots of motivation and focus to reach to a goal and maintain it. But I once read a book named Atomic Habit where author recommends just gradual 1 percentage improvement which is ideal for our mind to keep being motivated to work on our goal, and the 1 percent might sound small initially but its later compound to give greater result (Clear, 2018). But still user might find it difficult to work on 1 percent improvement and track their progress, so they need some addictive platform to implement all these ideas. From that book I come up with idea to create an app to better implement the ideas I leaned from that book and adding extra functionality which I felt are needed according to my life.
 In short problem I faced was:
1.	Boring to work on our self-improvement or in our goals
2.	Hard to keep track of our progress.
3.	Lots of complexity about how to break big goal into small reachable milestones with constant progress.
4.	Confusion about from where to start if we got no aim to reach.
5.	Overfocusing in one goal while ignoring other area.

### 1.2 Project as a solution	
To solve the complexities, I come up with this self-productivity app which provide user all required features in easy-to-use mobile platform to track their habits which are divided into small manageable task by the app with lots of features to make the app addictive so that user get hooked to use the app.
The solution my app provide are:
1.	App will provide amazing mobile platform UI with addictive features like Leader board game, monthly random chart and 21-day chain to not make app boring.
2.	 App will show graph so that user can keep track of their progress with milestones.
3.	App will break all user’s goal into small pieces with continuous increase or decrease in difficulty as they complete task.
4.	App will give user premade workout, diet, and study routine so that user don’t have to worry about from where to start.
5.	 App will make sure user is focusing in all 5 domains equally, if not app must alert user.







## 2.0 Aims and Objectives
### 2.1 Aims
The aim of the project is to create self-productivity app which is easy to use, addictive, informative and can break all the big complexity of our goal into small manageable task with milestones so that user can focus equally on all the domain of their life without getting distracted or bored.
 ### 2.2 Objective
1.	I will create amazing mobile platform UI with addictive features like Leader board game, monthly random chart and 21-day chain to not make app boring.
2.	 I will create graph so that user can keep track of their progress with milestones.
3.	I will work on inner processing which break all user’s goal into small pieces with continuous increase or decrease in difficulty as they complete task.
4.	I will give user premade workout, diet, and study routine so that user don’t have to worry about from where to start.
5.	 I will work on inner processing which make sure user is focusing in all 5 domains equally, if not app must alert user.
      









## 3.0 Expected Outcomes and deliverables 
The final app which I am going to be develop will be named as “Digi3Map” where “Digi” means digital, and “Map” means direction for the day. The app must give user amazing user interface to perform all the features of the app. 
The features the app provide are:
1.	Authentication like Sign Up, Log In, user token for security, Forgot password and email OTP verification.
2.	Online database to sync and save data to server when user is online.
3.	Monthly Leader Board Area Game with Trophy Point to one of the players who worked hardest among randomly assigned 10 players of his/her group.
4.	Every month new Group Chart portal among those randomly assigned 10 players, where every month they can meet random new friends, share similar interest, progress, or share advice with other competitors.
5.	Report user for misbehaviour resulting in banding the user in next leader board if he/she get more than 5 report among other 9 players.
6.	Special Effect Shop where user can trade Trophy with special effects cards which when activated gives special effect for one month to user profile picture, name, and message in the group chart portal, which makes user feel special among other members. 
7.	Score calculation with cheating protection for Leader Board Game.
8.	Default 2 compulsory domain like fitness and career with premade routine like workout, diet on fitness domain and studying on career domain to collect score for Leader Board.
9.	Extra 3 domain which user can create with priority setting among them, and it’s another way to collect scores.
10.	Algorithm to find best diet, gym routine, or study routine according to user’s resources constraints which is made by doing researching on different external source. And contains modification option if user got his own better routine.
11.	Increase or decrease in difficulty level of routine using past data of how user is progressing toward the task
12.	21-day Habit chain for Leader Board Score where the chain make sure user misses no day on habit’s routine else the chain will be broken, and user must start again from beginning. The better the chain the better the scoring.
13.	Offline database to save all user progress in absence of network.
14.	Algorithm which analyses past offline database to find best small task so that user is focusing equally in all 5 domains. If user over focusing in one domain, app priorities and alert another ignored domain’s task more.
15.	Energy level filter to sort current goal according to current user energy level to make user don’t break the habit chain even by performing very easy task when his/her energy level is very low.
16.	Notification feature for alert.
17.	Progress tracking graph with milestones to keep user motivated of their progress or make them demotivated for skipping their tasks.
