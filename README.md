## 3.0 Expected Outcomes and deliverables 
The final app which I am going to be develop will be named as “Digi3Map” where “Digi” means digital, and “Map” means direction for the day. The app must give user amazing user interface to perform all the features of the app. 
The features the app provide are:
1.	Authentication like Sign Up, Log In, user token for security, Forgot password and email OTP verification.
2.	Online database to sync and save data to server when user is online.
3.	Monthly Leader Board Area Game with Trophy Point to one of the players who worked hardest among randomly assigned 10 players of his/her group.
4.	Every month new Group Chart portal among those randomly assigned 10 players, where every month they can meet random new friends, share similar interest, progress, or share advice with other competitors.
5.	Report user for misbehaviour resulting in banding the user in next leader board if he/she get more than 5 report among other 9 players.
6.	Special Effect Shop where user can trade Trophy with special effects cards which when activated gives special effect for one month to user profile picture, name, and message in the group chart portal, which makes user feel special among other members. 
7.	Score calculation with cheating protection for Leader Board Game.
8.	Default 2 compulsory domain like fitness and career with premade routine like workout, diet on fitness domain and studying on career domain to collect score for Leader Board.
9.	Extra 3 domain which user can create with priority setting among them, and it’s another way to collect scores.
10.	Algorithm to find best diet, gym routine, or study routine according to user’s resources constraints which is made by doing researching on different external source. And contains modification option if user got his own better routine.
11.	Increase or decrease in difficulty level of routine using past data of how user is progressing toward the task
12.	21-day Habit chain for Leader Board Score where the chain make sure user misses no day on habit’s routine else the chain will be broken, and user must start again from beginning. The better the chain the better the scoring.
13.	Offline database to save all user progress in absence of network.
14.	Algorithm which analyses past offline database to find best small task so that user is focusing equally in all 5 domains. If user over focusing in one domain, app priorities and alert another ignored domain’s task more.
15.	Energy level filter to sort current goal according to current user energy level to make user don’t break the habit chain even by performing very easy task when his/her energy level is very low.
16.	Notification feature for alert.
17.	Progress tracking graph with milestones to keep user motivated of their progress or make them demotivated for skipping their tasks.
